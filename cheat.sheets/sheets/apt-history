# apt-history
# Command-line tool to pretty-print and filter the APT log

# Filter log entries by installations made by user 'ichy'.
apt-history -u ichy -A Install

# Filter log entries by removals affecting the package 'firefox:amd64'
apt-history -A Remove -p firefox:amd64

# By default, `apt-history` paginates using less(1) or more(1), but this can be
# disabled with the `-P` flag. In this example, only log entries made by the
# current user will be displayed.
#
# Thanks to the `-r` flag, the output is reversed, meaning that the newest
# entries show last.
apt-history -r -u $USER -P

# You might prefer your packages to be listed out in a wrapped way, more like
# you'd see in the '/var/log/apt/history.log' file, without all of the version
# strings.
#
# Using the `-c` flag, this example will include the actual command executed.
apt-history -D Wrapped -c
