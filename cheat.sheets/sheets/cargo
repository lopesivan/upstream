# Cargo is the Rust package manager
# Cargo downloads your Rust project's dependencies,
# compiles your project, makes packages, and upload them to crates.io
# See also: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

# To start a new project
cargo new hello_world --bin     # program
cargo new hello_world --lib     # library

# Build a project without optimizations (in debug mode)
cargo build

# Build a project with optimizations turned on
cargo build --release

# Build and run (without optimizations) a package with Cargo
cargo run

# Updates dependencies in Cargo.lock
cargo update            # update all
cargo update -p rand    # updates just “rand” crate
