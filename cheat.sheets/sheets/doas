# doas
# Execute commands as another user
#
# OpenBSD's lightweight sudo alternative, "dedicated openbsd application
# subexecutor", was created by Ted Unangst after he was dissatisfied with the
# complexity of sudo(8) and had issues with its default configuration.

# Execute COMMAND as USER. If the -u option is not specified, `doas` will by
# default operate as the 'root' user.
doas -u USER COMMAND

# Show the contents of '/etc/shadow' as root
doas cat /etc/shadow

# Execute the shell defined in `$SHELL` as root
doas -s

# Permission to execute commands as another user are given in the config file
# '/etc/doas.conf'. The following line grants permission for every user in the
# 'wheel' group to execute commands as the 'root' user:
#
#   permit persist keepenv :wheel
#
# The option 'persist' makes doas only ask for the password once in each
# shell session. The use of the colon (':') specifies that "wheel" is a
# group, not a user. The option 'keepenv' keeps the current environment
# variables.
#
# The following line rejects permission for 'user' to run commands as 'anon', -
# if the user is not specified, it will default to the 'root' user.
#
#   deny user as anon
#
# The following line allows "user" to execute only the program "shutdown" as
# root, without asking for a password.
#
#   permit nopass user cmd shutdown
