# Change file mode bits

# Give the [u]ser who owns a file the right to e[x]ecute it.
chmod u+x PATH

# Give the [u]ser rights to [r]ead and [w]rite to a file/directory.
chmod u+rw PATH

# Remove e[x]ecutable rights from the [g]roup.
chmod g-x PATH

# Give [a]ll users rights to [r]ead and e[x]ecute.
chmod a+rx PATH

# Give [o]thers (not in the file owner's group) the same rights as the [g]roup.
chmod o=g PATH

# Remove all rights from [o]thers.
chmod o= PATH

# Change permissions recursively, allowing [g]roup and [o]thers to [w]rite.
chmod -R g+w,o+w PATH

# Set access rights using numeric (octal) form.
chmod 750 PATH

# Add the execute permission bit to directories only. This works because the
# 'X' is uppercase, meaning only directories will be executable. However, if
# an existing file is executable, this bit will not be removed.
chmod a+X PATH

# Convert string representation of the access right into numeric form and back.
