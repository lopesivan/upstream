# extundelete
# Utility to recover deleted files from ext3/ext4 partition

# Recover a file in '/home/UserName', assuming '/home' is on its own partition
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-file UserName/SomeDirectory

# Recover an entire directory
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-directory UserName/SomeDirectory

# For advanced users, to manually recover blocks or inodes with extundelete,
# `debugfs` can be used to find the inode to be recovered; additional inodes
# to recover can be listed in an unspaced, comma-separated fashion.
extundelete --restore-inode inode

# recover all deleted files from an entire partition
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-all
