# bar
# The terms foobar (/ˈfuːbɑːr/), or foo and others are used as metasyntactic
# variables and placeholder names

# The etymology of foobar is generally traced
# to the World War II military slang FUBAR,
# which evolved through being bowdlerised to foobar

# In this Scheme sample, foobar is used to illustrate the name of a function:
(define foobar
   (lambda (x)
      (display x)))
(foobar "Hello World!")
