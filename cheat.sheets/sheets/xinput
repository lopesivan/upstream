# are as follows.
#
# 1: X Sensitivity
# 2: Rotates the Y axis
# 3: No idea. Didn't appear to do anything
# 4: Rotates the X axis
# 5: Y Sensitivity
#
# Beyond that, I'm not sure because I didn't test them. X and Y are the main
# ones anyway. These CTM values and their order may differ from your mouse.
