# mount
# Mount a filesystem

# Mount a temporary filesystem (TMPFS) of 4GB to '/mnt'. The contents will
# vanish when you reboot, but this can be very useful when working with things
# like bootstrap tarballs or temporary storages for sensitive data.
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755,size=4096M tmpfs /mnt
