# Cargo is the Rust package manager. It downloads your Rust project's dependencies,
# compiles your project, creates packages, and uploads them to crates.io.
# See also: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

# To create a blank application:
cargo new hello_world # or cargo new --bin hello_world

# To create a blank library:
cargo new --lib hello_world

# Build a project without optimizations (in debug mode).
cargo build

# Compile and check a project for errors (faster than cargo build)
cargo check

# Build a project with all optimizations turned on
cargo build --release

# Build and run a binary application with Cargo (in debug mode).
cargo run

# Run the project tests (from src/ and tests/)
cargo test

# Generate rustdoc documentation for your package
cargo doc

# Publishes your package to the registry, using information from Cargo.toml
cargo publish

# Updates dependencies in Cargo.lock
cargo update            # update all
cargo update -p rand    # update just "rand" crate

# Clean all build files
cargo clean

# Search for a package
cargo search

# Build and install a binary package into ~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install
