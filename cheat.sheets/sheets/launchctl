# launchctl
# A command-line interface to Apple's launchd manager
#
# for launch daemons (system-wide services) and launch agents (per-user
# programs). launchd loads XML-based *.plist files placed in the appropriate
# locations, and runs the corresponding commands according to their defined
# schedule.

# Activate user-specific agent to load into launchd whenever the user logs in.
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my_script.plist

# Activate an agent which requires root privileges to run and/or should be
# loaded whenever any user logs in (note the absence of ~ in the path).
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/root_script.plist

# Activate a system-wide daemon to be loaded whenever the system boots up, -
# even if no user logs in.
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/system_daemon.plist

# Show all loaded agents/daemons, with the PID if the process they specify is
# currently running, and the exit code returned the last time they ran.
launchctl list

# Unload a currently-loaded agent to, for example, make changes. The plist file
# is automatically loaded into launchd after a reboot and/or logging in.
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my_script.plist

# Manually run a known (loaded) agent/daemon, even if it isnâ€™t the right time
# This command uses the agent's label, rather than the filename.
launchctl start my_script

# Manually kill the process associated with a known agent/daemon, if running.
launchctl stop my_script
