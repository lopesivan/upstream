# sgdisk
# Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator for Linux and Unix

# convert an MBR partition table to GPT, use sgdisk
sgdisk -g /dev/sda

# convert GPT to MBR use the m option.
# it is not possible to convert more than four partitions from GPT to MBR
sgdisk -m /dev/sda

# Sort GPT partitions
# when a new partition is created in the space between two partitions
# or a partition is deleted
sgdisk -s /dev/sda

# Create a binary backup consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT header,
# the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table
sgdisk -b=sgdisk-sda.bak

# Restore GPT/MBR backup:
sgdisk -l=sgdisk-sda.bak

# Clone partition layout of '/dev/sda' to another drive '/dev/sdc'
sgdisk -R=/dev/sdc /dev/sda

# Randomize GUIDs (after cloning)
sgdisk -G /dev/sdc
