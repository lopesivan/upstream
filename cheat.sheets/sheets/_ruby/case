# Similar to a switch statement if you've used C/C++/Java, but Ruby's
# is a bit more powerful.

# Basic value tests
num = 5
case num
when 1
  puts "it's one"
when 3
  puts "wow, it's three"
when 5
  puts "five golden rings"
end

# Ranges
num = 25
case num
when 1..10
  puts "between one and ten"
when 20..30
  puts "between twenty and thirty"
else
  puts "must be between ten and twenty"
end

# Regular expressions
str = "doe, a deer"
case str
when /food/
  puts "i'm hungry"
when /doe/
  puts "#{str}, a female deer"
end

# Please note that `case` uses `===` operator to match values.
# The following are equivalent:
case x
when Integer then "I'm a number"
when String then "I'm a text"
end

if Integer === x
  "I'm a number"
elsif String === x
  "I'm a text"
end
