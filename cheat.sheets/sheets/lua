# lua
# Simple, extensible, embeddable programming language

# You may not have access to the `lua` command, but instead to something like
# `lua5.3` or one of a different version. The following information assumes you
# have the `lua` command, as-is, but alternative commands may also work the
# same or similarly, version allowing.

# Start an interactive Lua shell:
lua

# Execute a Lua script.
lua script_name.lua
# Execute a Lua script, with arguments (IE: flags) given to the script itself.
lua script_name.lua [ARGS]

# Execute a Lua expression(s), as though executed from within a script.
lua -e 'print("Hello World")'

# All options are handled in order, except `-i`. For instance, an invocation
# like first set a to 1, then print the value of a (1), and finally run the
# file `script.lua`
lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua
